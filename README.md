   - Click the "Add Task" button in any quadrant to create a new task.
   - Enter your task details and assign it to the appropriate quadrant based on urgency and importance.

3. **Organize Tasks:**
   - Drag and drop tasks between quadrants as their priority changes.
   - Use the delete button to remove tasks you've completed or no longer need.

4. **Understand the Quadrants:**
   - **Urgent & Important:** Do these tasks first.
   - **Not Urgent & Important:** Schedule these tasks.
   - **Urgent & Not Important:** Delegate these tasks if possible.
   - **Not Urgent & Not Important:** Consider deleting or ignoring these tasks.

5. **Switch Modes Anytime:**
   - You can switch between Local and Cloud mode at any time using the toggle in the navbar.
